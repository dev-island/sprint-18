# SQL Migrations

SQL migrations are a method of managing and versioning the changes in your database schema over time. They are essentially scripts that alter your database schema, adding or removing tables, columns, or entries. They allow database schemas to evolve as requirements change.

## Why We Need Them

Migrations are necessary for maintaining consistency between the database schema and the application code that interacts with it. They allow developers to manage changes to the database schema and apply them in a controlled and systematic way.

## Benefits

1. **Version Control for Database Schema:** Migrations allow you to keep your database schema in sync with your application code and track changes over time.

2. **Collaboration:** Migrations make it easier for teams to collaborate. Each member can update the database schema on their local machine by running the migration scripts.

3. **Deployment:** Migrations simplify the deployment process. You can update the database schema on the production server by running the migration scripts.

## Challenges

1. **Complexity:** Writing migration scripts can be complex, especially for large databases or complex changes.

2. **Rollbacks:** If a migration script fails, you need to have a rollback script to revert the changes. Writing rollback scripts can be challenging.
